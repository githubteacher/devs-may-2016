## Reasons a chat messenger would be great in GitHub

1. It'd be nice to be able to chat with collaborators, directly within GitHub, regarding pull request comments.
2. We could chat with each other live while reviewing code.
3. Fluid workflow when making changes and reviewing code.

Sounds like there are some plugins for this already so that is great!!!
